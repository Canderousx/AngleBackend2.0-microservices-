### **Important: This version of Angle Backend is under active development and heavy refactoring. It is not finished and may undergo significant changes at any time.**

This project is the newest iteration of Angle Backend (see: https://github.com/Canderousx/AngleBackend) and it is incompatible with the current Angle Frontend (see: https://github.com/Canderousx/Angle_Frontend). 

**A new frontend that supports this version is still under initial development**.


## What's new?

- The backend has been divided into microservices
- Apache Kafka as a message broker
- WebSocket for real-time user notifications
- Redis and Spring Cache for data caching.


### Stay tuned for updates:)
